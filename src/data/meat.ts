      "They may be simple, but chicken cutlets will forever be one of our favorite options for versatile protein. Our recipe combines panko bread crumbs and Parmesan for a final coating that gets perfectly crispy-chewy when pan-fried. Serve the cutlets alongside roasted veggies, sliced atop salads, or between bread for a crispy chicken sandwich–the options are endless!",
